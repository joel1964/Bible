Psalms 124:1 - If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;

Psalms 124:2 - If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:

Psalms 124:3 - Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:

Psalms 124:4 - Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:

Psalms 124:5 - Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.

Psalms 124:6 - Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.

Psalms 124:7 - Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.

Psalms 124:8 - Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
