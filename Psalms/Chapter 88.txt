Psalms 88:1 --> O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: 

Psalms 88:2 --> Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry; 

Psalms 88:3 --> For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave. 

Psalms 88:4 --> I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that hath no strength: 

Psalms 88:5 --> Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand. 

Psalms 88:6 --> Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps. 

Psalms 88:7 --> Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah. 

Psalms 88:8 --> Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth. 

Psalms 88:9 --> Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee. 

Psalms 88:10 --> Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise thee? Selah. 

Psalms 88:11 --> Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction? 

Psalms 88:12 --> Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? 

Psalms 88:13 --> But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee. 

Psalms 88:14 --> LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me? 

Psalms 88:15 --> I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted. 

Psalms 88:16 --> Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off. 

Psalms 88:17 --> They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together. 

Psalms 88:18 --> Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.
